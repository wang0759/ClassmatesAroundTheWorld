python project with flask
Using Pycharm, create a flask application with three routes:
Default page displays a simple menu:
Option 1 of the menu is used to display the Google map of the city of a specific student.
Option 2 of the menu displays a table of all students, country and cities.
the findStudent page displays a form where the user can select a student and the page then opens a Google map of the city from where the student is from.
The displayAll page displays a simple table of all students, cities and countries stored in the database. Each student name is also a hyperlink that opens in a new window a Google map of the city from where the student is from. Bonus: The table headings sort the table according to the heading.
